    Boards abstract over different storage backends, making it easy to
    share data in a vareity of ways.

  desc: >
    Prior to v1.0.0, pins used a different interface where the board was
    implicit, not explicit. These functions remain so old code continues to
    work, but we recommend that you move away from them.

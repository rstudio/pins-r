A new version of `pins` is available on CRAN! `pins 0.3` comes with many improvements and the following major features:

- Support for new **cloud boards** to pin resources in [Azure](../../../articles/boards-azure.html), [GCloud](../../../articles/boards-gcloud.html) and [S3](../../../articles/boards-s3.html) storage.
- Retrieve **pin information** with `pin_info()` including properties particular to each board.

You can install this new version from CRAN as follows:

```r
install.packages("pins")
```

In addition, there is a new [Use Cases](https://rstudio.github.io/pins/articles/use-cases.html) section in our docs, various improvements (see [NEWS](https://rstudio.github.io/pins/news/index.html)) and two community extensions being developed to support [databases](https://rstudio.github.io/connections/#pins) and [Nextcloud](https://gitlab.com/gwmngilfen/nextcloudr) as boards.

## Cloud Boards

`pins 0.3` adds support to find, retrieve and store resources in various cloud providers like: [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) and [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/).

To illustrate how they work, lets first try to find the World Bank indicators dataset in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/):

```r
library(pins)
pin_find("indicators", board = "kaggle")
```
```
# A tibble: 6 x 4
  name                                            description                             type  board 
  <chr>                                           <chr>                                   <chr> <chr> 
1 worldbank/world-development-indicators          World Development Indicators            files kaggle
2 theworldbank/world-development-indicators       World Development Indicators            files kaggle
3 cdc/chronic-disease                             Chronic Disease Indicators              files kaggle
4 bigquery/worldbank-wdi                          World Development Indicators (WDI) Data files kaggle
5 rajanand/key-indicators-of-annual-health-survey Health Analytics                        files kaggle
6 loveall/human-happiness-indicators              Human Happiness Indicators              files kaggle
```

Which we can then easily download with `pin_get()`, beware this is a 2GB download:

```r
pin_get("worldbank/world-development-indicators")
```
```
[1] "/.../worldbank/world-development-indicators/Country.csv"     
[2] "/.../worldbank/world-development-indicators/CountryNotes.csv"
[3] "/.../worldbank/world-development-indicators/database.sqlite" 
[4] "/.../worldbank/world-development-indicators/Footnotes.csv"   
[5] "/.../worldbank/world-development-indicators/hashes.txt"      
[6] "/.../worldbank/world-development-indicators/Indicators.csv"  
[7] "/.../worldbank/world-development-indicators/Series.csv"      
[8] "/.../worldbank/world-development-indicators/SeriesNotes.csv" 
```

The `Indicators.csv` file contains all the indicators, so let's load it with [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/):

```r
indicators <- pin_get("worldbank/world-development-indicators")[6] |>
  readr::read_csv()
```

Analysing this dataset would be quite interesting; however, this post focuses on how to share this in S3, Google Cloud or Azure storage. More specifically, we will learn how to publish to an [S3 board](../../../articles/boards-s3.html). To publish to other cloud providers, take a look at the [Google Cloud](../../../articles/boards-gcloud.html) and [Azure boards](../../../articles/boards-azure.html) articles.

As you would expect, the first step is to register the S3 board. When using RStudio, you can use the [New Connection](../../../articles/pins-rstudio.html) action to guide you through this process, or you can specify your `key` and `secret` as follows. Please refer to the [S3 board](../../../articles/boards-s3.html) article to understand how to store your credentials securely.

```r
board_register_s3(name = "rpins",
                  bucket  = "rpins",
                  key = "VerySecretKey",
                  secret = "EvenMoreImportantSecret")
```

With the S3 board registered, we can now pin the indicators dataset with `pin()`:

```r
pin(indicators, name = "worldbank/indicators", board = "rpins")
```

That's about it! We can now find and retrieve this dataset from S3 using `pin_find()`, `pin_get()` or view the uploaded resources in the S3 management console:

![](images/pins-upload-s3-results.png)

To make this even easier for others to consume, we can make this S3 bucket public; which means you can now connect to this board without even having to configure S3, making it possible to retrieve this dataset with just one line of R code!

```r
pins::pin_get("worldbank/indicators", "https://rpins.s3.amazonaws.com")
```
```

```

This works since `pins 0.3` automatically register URLs as a [website board](../../../articles/boards-websites.html) to save you from having to explicitly call `board_register_datatxt()`.

It's also worth mentioning that `pins` stores the dataset using an R native format, which requires only 72MB and loads much faster than the original 2GB dataset.

## Pin Information

Boards like [Kaggle](../../../articles/boards-kaggle.html) and [RStudio Connect](../../../articles/boards-rsconnect.html), store additional information for each pin which you can now easily retrieve with `pin_info()`.

For instance, we can retrieve additional properties from the indicators pin from Kaggle as follows,

```r
pin_info("worldbank/world-development-indicators", board = "kaggle")
```
```

And from RStudio Connect boards as well,

```r
pin_info("worldnews", board = "rsconnect")
```
```

#   - cols: 1
```

To retrieve all the extended information when discovering pins, pass `extended = TRUE` to `pin_find()`.

\title{Use a vector of URLs as a board}
\usage{
board_url(
  urls,
  cache = NULL,
  use_cache_on_failure = is_interactive(),
  versioned = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{urls}{A named character vector of URLs If the URL ends in a \code{/},
\code{board_url} will look for a \code{data.txt} that provides metadata. The
easiest way to generate this file is to upload a pin directory created by
\code{\link[=board_folder]{board_folder()}}.}

\item{cache}{Cache path. Every board requires a local cache to avoid
downloading files multiple times. The default stores in a standard
cache location for your operating system, but you can override if needed.}

\item{use_cache_on_failure}{If the pin fails to download, is it ok to
use the last cached version? Defaults to \code{is_interactive()} so you'll
be robust to poor internet connectivity when exploring interactively,
but you'll get clear errors when the code is deployed.}

\item{versioned}{Should this board be registered with support for versions?}
}
\description{
\code{board_url()} lets you build up a board from individual urls. This is
useful because \code{\link[=pin_download]{pin_download()}} and \code{\link[=pin_read]{pin_read()}} will be cached - they'll
only re-download the data if it's changed from the last time you downloaded
it (using the tools of
\href{https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching}{HTTP caching}).
You'll also be protected from the vagaries of the internet; if a fresh
download fails, you'll get the previously cached result with a warning.

\code{board_url()} is read only.

\title{Upload and download files to and from a board}
\usage{
pin_download(board, name, version = NULL, hash = NULL, ...)

pin_upload(board, paths, name = NULL, desc = NULL, metadata = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{board}{A pin board, created by \code{\link[=board_folder]{board_folder()}}, \code{\link[=board_rsconnect]{board_rsconnect()}},
\code{\link[=board_url]{board_url()}} or other other \code{board_} function.}

\item{name}{Pin name.}

\item{version}{For boards that support versions, this allows you to retrieve
a specific version of a pin. See \verb{vignette("versioning)"} for details.}

\item{hash}{Specify a hash to verify that you get exactly the dataset that
you expect. You can find the hash of an existing pin by looking for
\code{pin_hash} in \code{\link[=pin_meta]{pin_meta()}}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed on to methods for a specific board.}

\item{paths}{A character vector of file paths to upload to \code{board}.}

\item{desc}{A text description of the pin; most important for
shared boards so that others can understand what the pin contains.
If omitted, pins will generate a brief description of the contents.}

\item{metadata}{A list containing additional metadata to store with the pin.
When retrieving the pin, this will be stored in the \code{user} key, to
avoid potential clashes with the metadata that pins itself uses.}
}
\value{
\code{pin_download()} returns a character vector of file paths;
\code{pin_upload()} returns \code{board}, invisibly.
}
\description{
This is a lower-level interface than \code{pin_read()} and \code{pin_write()} that
you can use to pin any file.

\examples{
board <- board_temp()

board \%>\% pin_upload(system.file("CITATION"))
path <- board \%>\% pin_download("CITATION")
path
readLines(path)[1:5]

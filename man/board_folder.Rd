\usage{
board_folder(path, name = "folder", versioned = FALSE)

board_local(versioned = FALSE)

board_temp(name = "temp", versioned = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to directory to store pins. Will be created if it
doesn't already exist.}

\item{name}{An optional name used identify the board. This is no longer
generally needed since you should be passing around an explicit
board object.}

\item{versioned}{Should this board be registered with support for versions?}
}
\description{
\itemize{
\item \code{board_folder()} creates a board inside a folder. You can use this to
share files by using a folder on a shared network drive or inside
a DropBox.
\item \code{board_local()} creates a board in a system data directory. It's useful
if you want to share pins between R sessions on your computer, and you
don't care where the data lives.
\item \code{board_temp()} creates a temporary board that lives in a session
specific temporary directory. It will be automatically deleted once
the current R session ends. It's useful for examples and tests.

The pins package helps you publish data sets, models, and other R
objects, making it easy to share them across projects and with your
colleagues. You can pin objects to a variety of “boards”, including
local folders (to share on a networked drive or with dropbox), RStudio
Connect, Amazon S3, and more.

pins 1.0.0 includes a new API that is designed to be more explicit and
less magical, as well as providing much more robust versioning. The
legacy API (`pin()`, `pin_get()`, and `board_register()`) will continue
to work, but new features will only be implemented with the new API, so
we encourage you to switch to the modern API as quickly as possible.
Learn more in `vignette("pins-legacy")`.

## Installation

``` r
# Install the released version from CRAN:
install.packages("pins")
```

## Usage

To use the pins package, you must first create a pin **board**. A good
place to start is `board_folder()`, which stores pins in a directory you
specify. Here I’ll use a special version of `board_folder()` called
`board_temp()`; it creates a temporary board that’s automatically
deleted when your R session ends:

``` r
library(pins)

b <- board_temp()
b
#> Pin board <pins_board_folder>
#> Path: '/tmp/Rtmpgy7RFX/pins-78427a3adddc'
#> Cache size: 0
```

You can “pin” (save) data to that board with `pin_write()`. The first
argument is the object to pin (normally a data frame), and the second
argument is the name you’ll use to later retrieve it:

``` r
b %>% pin_write(head(mtcars), "mtcars")
#> Guessing `type = 'rds'`
#> Creating new version '20210806T175343Z-f8797'
```

As you can see, the data saved as an `.rds` by default, but depending on
what you’re saving and who else you want to read it, you might use the
`type` argument to instead save it as a `csv`, `json`, or `arrow` file.

You can later retrieve the pinned data with `pin_read()`:

``` r
b %>% pin_read("mtcars")
#>                    mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb
#> Mazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4
#> Mazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4
#> Datsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1
#> Hornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1
#> Hornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2
#> Valiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1
```

A board on your computer is good place to start, but the real power of
pins comes when you use a board that’s shared with multiple people. To
get started, you can use `board_folder()` with a directory on a shared
drive or in dropbox, or if you use [RStudio
Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/) you can use
`board_rsconnect()`:

``` r
b <- board_rsconnect()
b %>% pin_write(tidy_sales_data, "sales-summary")
#> Saving to hadley/sales-summary
```

Then, someone else (or an automated Rmd report!) can read and use your
pin:

``` r
b <- board_rsconnect()
b %>% pin_read("hadley/sales-summary")
```

You can easily control who gets to access the data using the RStudio
Connection permissions pane.

The pins package also includes boards that allow you to share data on S3
(`board_s3()`), Azure (`board_azure()`), and more. Learn more in
`vignette("pins")`.

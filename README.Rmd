The pins package helps you publish data sets, models, and other R objects, making it easy to share them across projects and with your colleagues.
You can pin objects to a variety of "boards", including local folders (to share on a networked drive or with dropbox), RStudio connect, Amazon S3, and more.

## Installation

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Install the released version from CRAN:
install.packages("pins")
```

## Usage

To use the pins package, you must first create a pin board.
A good place to start is `board_folder()` which stores pins in a directory you specific.
Here I'll use `board_temp()` which because it creates a temporary board that will evaporate when your R session ends:

```{r setup}
library(pins)

b <- board_temp()
b
```

Next you can to store some data in that board with `pin_write()`.
The first argument is the object to pin (normally a data frame) , and the second argument is the name you'll use to later retrieve it:

```{r}
b %>% pin_write(head(mtcars), "mtcars")
```

As you can see, it's saved as an `.rds` by default, but depending on what you're saving and who else you want to read it, you might save it as a `csv`, `json`, or `arrow` file.

Later, in a different R session, you can retrieve the data with `pin_read()`:

```{r}
b %>% pin_read("mtcars")
```

This can be convenient when working locally, but the real power of pins comes when you use a shared board, because because the writer and reader can be different people (or automated processes).
For example, you can RStudio Connect you can pin data to board that's accessible to your team:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
b <- board_rsconnect()
b %>% pin_write(tidy_sales_data, "sales-summary")
#> Saving to hadley/sales-summary
```

Then someone else (or an automated Rmd report) can read it:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
b <- board_rsconnect()
b %>% pin_read("hadley/sales-summary")
```

You can easily control who gets to access the data using the RStudio Connection permissions pane.

As well as RStudio connect, you can share your pins:

-   On GitHub: `board_github()`.
-   In Microsoft Azure's storage: `board_azure()`.
-   On Amazon's S3: `board_s3()`.

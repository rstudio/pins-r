The pins package helps you publish data sets, models, and other R objects, making it easy to share them across projects and with your colleagues.
You can pin objects to a variety of "boards", including local folders (to share on a networked drive or with dropbox), RStudio Connect, Amazon S3, and more.

pins 1.0.0 includes a new API that is designed to be more explicit and less magical, as well as providing much more robust versioning.
The legacy API (`pin()`, `pin_get()`, and `board_register()`) will continue to work, but new features will only be implemented with the new API, so we encourage you to switch to the modern API as quickly as possible.
Learn more in `vignette("pins-legacy")`.

## Installation

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Install the released version from CRAN:
install.packages("pins")
```

## Usage

To use the pins package, you must first create a pin **board**.
A good place to start is `board_folder()`, which stores pins in a directory you specify.
Here I'll use a special version of `board_folder()` called `board_temp()`; it creates a temporary board that's automatically deleted when your R session ends:

```{r setup}
library(pins)

b <- board_temp()
b
```

You can "pin" (save) data to that board with `pin_write()`.
The first argument is the object to pin (normally a data frame), and the second argument is the name you'll use to later retrieve it:

```{r}
b %>% pin_write(head(mtcars), "mtcars")
```

As you can see, the data saved as an `.rds` by default, but depending on what you're saving and who else you want to read it, you might use the `type` argument to instead save it as a `csv`, `json`, or `arrow` file.

You can later retrieve the pinned data with `pin_read()`:

```{r}
b %>% pin_read("mtcars")
```

A board on your computer is good place to start, but the real power of pins comes when you use a board that's shared with multiple people.
To get started, you can use `board_folder()` with a directory on a shared drive or in dropbox, or if you use [RStudio Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/) you can use `board_rsconnect()`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
b <- board_rsconnect()
b %>% pin_write(tidy_sales_data, "sales-summary")
#> Saving to hadley/sales-summary
```

Then, someone else (or an automated Rmd report!) can read and use your pin:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
b <- board_rsconnect()
b %>% pin_read("hadley/sales-summary")
```

You can easily control who gets to access the data using the RStudio Connection permissions pane.

The pins package also includes boards that allow you to share data on S3 (`board_s3()`), Azure (`board_azure()`), and more.
Learn more in `vignette("pins")`.

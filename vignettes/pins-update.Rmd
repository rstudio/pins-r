pins 1.0.0 introduced a completely new API.
While the legacy API will continue to be supported for some time, it will not gain any new features, so it's good to plan to switch to the new interface.
This vignette shows a couple of examples of updating legacy code to the modern API, then provides a full set of equivalences between the legacy and modern function names.

```{r setup}
library(pins)
```

## Examples

A simple example of the legacy API looks something like this:

```{r}
# Legacy API
board_register_local("vignette", tempfile())

pin(head(mtcars), "mtcars", board = "vignette")
pin_get("mtcars", board = "vignette")
```

To convert to the modern API you need to make two major changes:

-   Instead of registering a named board, you create an explicit board object.
-   You use `pin_read()` and `pin_write()` instead of `pin_get()` and `pin()`.

```{r}
# Modern API
board <- board_local()

pin_write(board, head(mtcars), "mtcars")
pin_read(board, "mtcars")
```

Since the board object is always the first argument, you might also want to use the pipe:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Sys.sleep(1)
```

```{r}
# Modern API
board <- board_local()

board %>% pin_write(head(mtcars), "mtcars")
board %>% pin_read("mtcars")
```

### Pinning files

Another way to use `pin()` is with a path to a file:

```{r}
# Legacy API
path <- tempfile()
writeLines(letters, path)

pin(path, "alphabet", board = "vignette")
pin_get("alphabet", board = "vignette")
```

pins 1.0.0 clearly separates the two cases of pin an object and pinning a file, so here instead of `pin_write()` and `pin_read()` you need to `pin_upload()` and `pin_download()`:

```{r}
# Modern API
board %>% pin_upload(path, "alphabet")
board %>% pin_download("alphabet")
```

### Pinning a url

Finally, you can `pin()` a url to automatically re-download it when it changes:

```{r}
# Legacy API
base <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/pins-r/master/tests/testthat/"

(pin(paste0(base, "pin-files/first.txt"), board = "vignette"))
```

This now needs to be made explicit with the new `board_url()`, and since this returns a path, not a file, you need to use `pin_download()`:

```{r}
# Modern API
board_github <- board_url(c(
  raw = paste0(base, "pin-files/first.txt")
))
board_github %>% pin_download("raw")
```

### Implicit board

It's also possible to use `pin()` and `pin_get()` without an explicit board argument, in which case it automatically uses a local board:

```{r}
# Legacy API
pin(data.frame(x = 1:3), "test-data")
pin_get("test-data")
```

To convert this code, you need to create an explicit `board_local()`:

```{r}
# Modern API
board <- board_local()

board %>% pin_write(data.frame(x = 1:3), "test-data")
board %>% pin_read("test-data")
```

## Equivalents

Future releases will add support for additional boards based on user feedback.

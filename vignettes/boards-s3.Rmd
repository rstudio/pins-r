## Registering

In order to use Amazon S3 Storage as a [board](boards-understanding.html), you need an Amazon S3 bucket and a user key enabled for programmatic access container created with enough permissions to access the S3 bucket. You can sign-up and create those from [amazonaws.com](http://amazonaws.com). Please notice that after crating a bucket, it can take several minutes for this bucket to be usable.

You can then use the S3 Storage bucket, key, and secret to authenticate:

```{r eval=FALSE}
board_register_s3(bucket = "pinsbucket",
                  key = "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
                  secret = "ABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCA==")
```

Notice that `board_register_s3()` is just an alias with named parameters to `board_register()`; the previous code is equivalent to:

```{r eval=FALSE}
board_register("s3", bucket = "pinsbucket",
                     key = "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
                     secret = "ABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCA==")
```

Once the board is registered, you can pin and search using `pin()`, `pin_get()` and `pin_find()`.

## Pinning

Like in other boards, you can create pins for `iris` and `mtcars` by setting `board` to Amazon S3 Bucket's name,

```{r eval=FALSE}
pin(iris, description = "The iris data set", board = "s3")
pin(mtcars, description = "The motor trend cars data set", board = "s3")
```

After a pin is created, the pin also becomes available in the Amazon S3 Bucket; by default, they are created as private datasets.

You can also retrieve pins back from this repo using the now familiar `pin_get()` function. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
pin_get("iris", board = "s3")
```
```

Notice you can also retrieve an arbitrary file using a URL instead of a name:

```{r eval=FALSE}
pin_get("https://pinsbucket.region.amazonaws.com/iris/data.csv", board = "s3")
```

## Discovering

You can then search pins in your S3 board using `pin_find()`, which by default search all boards but you can also explicitly request to use this particular board:

```{r eval=FALSE}
pin_find("data", board = "s3")
```
```
# A tibble: 2 x 4
  name   description                   type  board
  <chr>  <chr>                         <chr> <chr>
1 iris   The iris data set             table s3   
2 mtcars The motor trend cars data set table s3 
```

Notice that the given 'data' search keyword is searched in the name and description fields for the pins available in this repo.

Pins offers a lot of ways to manage back-and-forth collaboration using, for example, `board_s3()`.
The goal of this vignette is to show how a `board_url()` can bring your pins to a wider audience.

A couple of things to keep in mind:

 - For consumers, `board_url()` offers read-only collaboration.
 - For publishers, a helper function is provided, `write_board_manifest()`.
   A manfiest contains a list of pins and versions; this function lets
   you provide consumers with the same access to the board as you.
   
The rest of the vignette will go into greater detail on these points, providing examples.

## Consuming

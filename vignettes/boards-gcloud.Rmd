## Registering

In order to use Google Cloud Storage as a [board](boards-understanding.html), you need a Google Cloud Storage account, a Google Storage bucket, and an access token or the [Gogole Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) properly installed and configured. You can sign-up and create those from [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com):

You can then use the Google Cloud Storage bucket and implicitly the Google Cloud SDK (or an explicit token) to authenticate:

```{r eval=FALSE}
board_register_gcloud(bucket = "pinscontainer")
```

It is recommend to install the Google Cloud SDK to avoid managing access tokens; however, you can also retrieve an Access Token from [developers.google.com/oauthplayground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground). This approach requires you to authorize the "Google Storage API v1" scope.

Notice that `board_register_gcloud()` is just an alias with named parameters to `board_register()`; the previous code is equivalent to:

```{r eval=FALSE}
board_register("gcloud", bucket = "pinscontainer")
```

Once the board is registered, you can pin and search using `pin()`, `pin_get()` and `pin_find()`.

## Pinning

Like in other boards, you can create pins for `iris` and `mtcars` by setting `board` to Kaggle's board name,

```{r eval=FALSE}
pin(iris, description = "The iris data set", board = "gcloud")
pin(mtcars, description = "The motor trend cars data set", board = "gcloud")
```

After a pin is created, the pin also becomes available in the Kaggle's dataset website; by default, they are created as private datasets.

You can also retrieve pins back from this repo using the now familiar `pin_get()` function. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
pin_get("iris", board = "gcloud")
```
```

```

## Discovering

You can then search pins in your Google Cloud board using `pin_find()`, which by default search all boards but you can also explicitly request to use this particular board:

```{r eval=FALSE}
pin_find("data", board = "gcloud")
```
```
# A tibble: 2 x 4
  name   description                   type  board 
  <chr>  <chr>                         <chr> <chr> 
1 iris   The iris data set             table gcloud
2 mtcars The motor trend cars data set table gcloud
```

Notice that the given 'data' search keyword is searched in the name and description fields for the pins available in this repo.
